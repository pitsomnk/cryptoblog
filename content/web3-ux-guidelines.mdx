Web3 UX remains a major adoption hurdle. From private key management to transaction UX, designers need to simplify while preserving security.

### Key principles

1. Progressive disclosure: hide advanced features behind clear affordances.
2. Contextual guidance: explain gas fees, confirmations, and signing in plain language.
3. Fallback experiences: provide read-only or custodial options for newcomers.

Small UX improvements — better defaults, clearer labels, fewer unexpected modals — significantly reduce churn for new users.
