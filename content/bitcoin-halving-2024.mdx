The Bitcoin halving is one of the most-watched events in the cryptocurrency calendar. Historically, halvings — where the block reward given to miners is cut in half — have had notable effects on miner economics and, indirectly, price dynamics.

### What a halving actually does

Technically, a halving reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created. This changes the supply schedule and can increase scarcity if demand stays constant or rises. Miners receive fewer BTC for the same work, which can result in short-term selling pressure as miners adjust operations.

### Historical context

Past halvings (2012, 2016, 2020) have preceded significant bull runs, although correlation is not causation. Market structure, macro conditions, and network fundamentals vary with each cycle.

### Risks and considerations

- Increased miner centralization risk if smaller miners become unprofitable.
- Short-term volatility around the halving date.
- Macroeconomic factors (rates, liquidity) that can overpower supply-driven effects.

In short, halvings alter supply dynamics and are an important variable for market participants to consider — but they are one of many factors that determine price action.
